Docker Setup and Managing Containers
___________________________________________________

Step 1: Download and Install Docker
If you havenâ€™t already, download Docker Desktop from the Docker website: 
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system 
(Windows, macOS, or Linux).

After installation, open Docker Desktop and sign in with your Docker 
account or create a new one if needed.
___________________________________________________

Step 2: Build the Docker Containers
Once Docker is installed and you are signed in, change to the 
directory containing your Dockerfile:

cd "...\CSC-4996-Footprint\footprint"

Now, build the Docker containers:

TERMINAL COMMAND:
"

docker-compose build

"

This will build the images as defined in the docker-compose.yml file based on the Dockerfile 
located in the current directory. This will take some time to Build, You'll know if you did it 
right if you can see the status in the terminal. 

NOTE: You don't always need to re-build docker, but if you do change the core docker files you'll
 need to rebuild docker. If dependencies are changed, the rebuild time will take longer. 
___________________________________________________

Step 3: Start the Containers
After building, start the containers:

TERMINAL COMMAND:
"

docker-compose up

"

This command will start up all services as specified in the docker-compose.yml file. 
This is where you can start using the video_Enqueue.py. You can also verify that Docker
 is up if you physically go into the docker application and see a footprint container running. 

NOTE: You will always need docker up if you want to use the AI model. 
___________________________________________________

Step 4: Stop the Containers
When you're ready to stop the running containers, use the following command:

TERMINAL COMMAND:
"

docker-compose down

"

This will gracefully stop and remove the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml 
file. This is done when you are done using the AI model. Its good practice to turn off 
docker before turning off your PC. you can also stop the container on the Docker 
application itself. Either works. 
___________________________________________________

If you make changes to the Dockerfile or any dependencies, repeat Step 2 to rebuild,
 then proceed with Step 3 to start up the updated containers.
