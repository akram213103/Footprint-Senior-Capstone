- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (64-bit)
- **Processor**: 2.0 GHz dual-core or higher
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM (minimum)
- **Storage**: 10 GB of free disk space

### **Software**
- **Docker Desktop**: Latest version
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or later
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Web Browsers**: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or Safari (latest versions)

### **Network**
- A stable internet connection is required.

## **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal on your Windows 11 laptop.
2. Clone the **Integration** branch of the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch Integration https://github.com/<your-repository-url>.git
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Command Prompt**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **PowerShell**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
1. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Build the Docker Container
1. Navigate to the `footprint` directory:
   ```bash
   cd footprint
   ```
2. Build the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## **Modifying Absolute Paths**

### Step 1: Locate the `views.py` File
1. Navigate to the `CSC-4996-Footprint/footprint/home` directory.
2. Open the `views.py` file in a code editor.

### Step 2: Update Absolute Paths
You must change two absolute paths to match your local setup:

1. **Path 1**: In the `check_and_run_boot_commands` function, find and replace the following:
   ```python
   boot_directory = R"C:\Users\17344\Documents\Capstone2\CSC-4996-Footprint\footprint"
   ```
   Replace it with the local path to the `footprint` directory on your machine.

2. **Path 2**: In the `upload` view, find and replace the following:
   ```python
   script_directory = R"C:\Users\17344\Documents\Capstone2\CSC-4996-Footprint\footprint\home\static\AI_Scripts"
   ```
   Replace it with the local path to the `AI_Scripts` directory within the `footprint/home/static` folder.

### Step 3: Save Changes
Save the `views.py` file after modifying these paths.

---

## **Running the Application**

### Step 1: Build and Start Docker
1. In the terminal, navigate to the `footprint` directory:
   ```bash
   cd footprint
   ```
2. Run the following commands in sequence:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Django Server
1. Open another terminal in the `footprint` directory.
2. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
3. Access the application via `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser.

---

## **Testing Environment**

- **Device**: Windows 11 laptop with Docker Desktop installed.
- **Network**: Stable internet connection.
- **Browsers**: Test on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or Safari (latest versions).

### Recommended Tests
1. Verify the application UI renders correctly across all supported browsers.
2. Upload videos at different processing speeds (slow, medium, fast).
3. Check real-time updates in the upload queue and AI dashboard.
4. Ensure database interactions (Firestore) work as expected.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
1. **Docker Build/Run Errors**:
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running before executing the commands.
   - Verify the `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured.

2. **Path Errors**:
   - Double-check the absolute paths updated in `views.py`.

3. **Server Not Starting**:
   - Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the server.

### Logs and Debugging
- Check Docker and Django logs for detailed error messages:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
